# Challenge - Candidates

This repository contains the solution to a Data Engineer Challenge focused on candidates data.

## Description

This is a challenge for a Data Engineer position at a random company. The challenge is to create an application to migrate the data to a relational database and display those data from the database in chart visualizations.

# Instructions provided

## What is Expected

We expect that you get the CSV file and create an application to migrate the data to a relational database. Also, you will display those data from the database in chart visualizations; remember, those data should be stored in a database, and your reports must come from the database, not the CSV file. Avoid using well-implemented tools for the ETL process; try using libraries as much as possible.

The visualizations that we are expecting are:

- Hires by technology (pie chart)
- Hires by year (horizontal bar chart)
- Hires by seniority (bar chart)
- Hires by country over years (USA, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador only)(multiline chart)

## Technologies

We expect you to use in this challenge:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
- [Jupiter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- Database (you choose)

## Data

We have 50k rows of data about candidates. The fields we are using are:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Country
- Application Date
- Yoe (years of experience)
- Seniority
- Technology
- Code Challenge Score
- Technical Interview

_Remember that we consider a candidate HIRED when he has both scores greater than or equal to 7; you should apply this logic to get the correct information. How you will handle this data is on you._

**And please remember, all the data here is totally random; we used a public library to generate random information.**
